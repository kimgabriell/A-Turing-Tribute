                The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a
                top private school. He entered the University of
                Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating
                in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King’s College
                (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research
                in probability theory. In 1936 Turing’s seminal paper
                “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
                Entscheidungsproblem [ Decision Problem]” was recommended
                for publication by the American mathematical logician
                Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper
                that reached the same conclusion as Turing’s, although
                by a different method. Turing’s method (but not so much
                Church’s) had profound significance for the emerging
                science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to
                Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical
                logic under Church’s direction (completed in 1938).

            <p><span class="boldTextHeading">The Entscheidungsproblem</span><br>
                What mathematicians called an “effective” method
                for solving a problem was simply one that could be
                carried by a human mathematical clerk working by
                rote. In Turing’s time, those rote-workers were in
                fact called “computers,” and human computers
                carried out some aspects of the work later done by
                electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem
                sought an effective method for solving the
                fundamental mathematical problem of determining
                exactly which mathematical statements are provable
                within a given formal mathematical system and which
                are not. A method for determining this is called a
                decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church
                independently showed that, in general, the
                Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution,
                proving that no consistent formal system of
                arithmetic has an effective decision method.
                In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some
                purely logical systems, considerably weaker than
                arithmetic, have no effective decision method.
                This result and others—notably
                mathematician-logician Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness
                results—dashed the hopes, held by some
                mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that
                would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods
                that (human) computers could carry out. It was in
                the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem
                that Turing invented the universal Turing machine,
                an abstract computing machine that encapsulates
                the fundamental logical principles of the digital
                computer.

            <p><span class="boldTextHeading">The Church-Turing thesis</span><br>
                An important step in Turing’s argument about
                the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now
                called the Church-Turing thesis, that
                everything humanly computable can also be
                computed by the universal Turing machine.
                The claim is important because it marks out
                the limits of human computation. Church in
                his work used instead the thesis that all
                human-computable functions are identical to
                what he called lambda-definable functions
                (functions on the positive integers whose
                values can be calculated by a process of
                repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936
                that Church’s thesis was equivalent to his own,
                by proving that every lambda-definable function
                is computable by the universal Turing machine
                and vice versa. In a review of Turing’s work,
                Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing’s
                formulation of the thesis over his own (which
                made no reference to computing machinery),
                saying that the concept of computability by a
                Turing machine “has the advantage of making
                the identification with effectiveness…evident
                immediately.”
